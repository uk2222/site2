It is an FDA approved, computer-guided laser that is programmed by the surgeon. Remember that, like a fingerprint, each human eye is entirely unique.

I understand that bespoke  <a href='https://www.laservisionscotland.co.uk/laser-eye-surgery/'>laser eye surgery</a> can provide excellent results.<br /><br>Additionally, lens fragmentation and softening reduce intraocular manipulations, and ultrasound energy can be reduced or even eliminated.

For reasons of effectiveness, we continue to prefer the standard phaco technique for mature and hypermature cataracts.
